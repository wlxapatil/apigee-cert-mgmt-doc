## 2. Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### 2.1 Phase 1: Foundation Setup

#### Step 1: Repository Initialization
```bash
# Create repository structure
mkdir -p .github/workflows scripts config/environments certs docs tests
touch README.md .gitignore

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial repository structure"

# Create .gitignore
cat > .gitignore << EOF
# Certificates
*.pem
*.p12
*.pfx
*.key
*.crt
*.cer

# Backup files
*.backup
*.bak

# Temporary files
*.tmp
.DS_Store

# Sensitive data
*-credentials.json
*-password.txt

# Test outputs
test-results/
coverage/
EOF
```

#### Step 2: Configure GitHub Repository
```yaml
Repository Settings:
  1. General:
     - Default branch: main
     - Disable: Wiki, Issues (use JIRA/ServiceNow)
     - Enable: Actions, Environments
  
  2. Secrets and Variables:
     - Add organization secrets
     - Add environment secrets
     - Configure variable groups
  
  3. Environments:
     - Create: dev, test, uat, production
     - Set protection rules
     - Add required reviewers
  
  4. Branches:
     - Protect main branch
     - Require PR reviews
     - Enable status checks
```

#### Step 3: Initial Configuration Files
```bash
# Create global config
cat > config/apigee-config.json << 'EOF'
{
  "organization": "${APIGEE_ORG}",
  "sso_url": "${APIGEE_SSO_URL}",
  "api_url": "${APIGEE_API_URL}",
  "scheduled_environments": ["dev", "test", "uat"],
  "cert_renewal_days": 30,
  "notification_channels": {
    "slack": {
      "enabled": false,
      "webhook_url_secret": "SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL"
    }
  }
}
EOF

# Create environment configs
for env in dev test uat prod; do
  cat > config/environments/${env}.json << EOF
{
  "keystore_name": "${env}-app-keystore",
  "domain": "app-${env}.example.com",
  "alias_name": "app-${env}-cert",
  "cert_type": "self-signed"
}
EOF
done
```

### 2.2 Phase 2: Core Feature Implementation

#### Step 4: Deploy Core Scripts
```bash
# Copy scripts to repository
cp apigee_auth.sh scripts/
cp apigee_keystore.sh scripts/
cp apigee_certs.sh scripts/

# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/*.sh

# Test scripts locally
export APIGEE_ORG="your-org"
export APIGEE_SSO_URL="https://your-sso.login.apigee.com"
export APIGEE_API_URL="https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1"

# Test authentication
./scripts/apigee_auth.sh "your-passcode"
```

#### Step 5: Create Non-Production Workflow
```yaml
# Deploy the non-production workflow
cp apigee-cert-management.yml .github/workflows/

# Test workflow syntax
# Use GitHub's workflow syntax validator or act tool
act -W .github/workflows/apigee-cert-management.yml --dryrun
```

#### Step 6: Configure Secrets
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI
gh secret set APIGEE_ORG --body "your-organization"
gh secret set APIGEE_SSO_URL --body "https://your-sso.login.apigee.com"
gh secret set APIGEE_API_URL --body "https://api.enterprise.apigee.com/v1"

# Set environment-specific secrets
for env in DEV TEST UAT; do
  gh secret set APIGEE_SSO_PASSCODE_${env} --env ${env,,}
  gh secret set KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_${env} --env ${env,,}
done
```

### 2.3 Phase 3: Production Implementation

#### Step 7: Production Workflow Setup
```bash
# Deploy production workflow
cp apigee-cert-prod-deployment.yml .github/workflows/

# Configure production environment
gh api repos/:owner/:repo/environments/production \
  --method PUT \
  --field wait_timer=300 \
  --field prevent_self_review=true \
  --field reviewers[][id]=TEAM_ID \
  --field deployment_branch_policy[protected_branches]=true
```

#### Step 8: Test Production Deployment
```yaml
Test Plan:
  1. Dry Run Test:
     - Execute with dry_run=true
     - Verify all validations pass
     - Check no actual deployment
  
  2. Test Environment:
     - Create test-prod environment
     - Mimic production settings
     - Full deployment test
  
  3. Rollback Test:
     - Deploy known good cert
     - Deploy bad cert
     - Execute rollback
     - Verify restoration
```

### 2.4 Phase 4: Enhancement and Go-Live

#### Step 9: Monitoring Setup
```bash
# Create monitoring dashboard config
cat > monitoring/dashboard.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "Apigee Certificate Management",
  "panels": [
    {
      "title": "Certificate Expiry Status",
      "type": "table",
      "query": "certificate_days_remaining by environment"
    },
    {
      "title": "Workflow Execution Status",
      "type": "graph",
      "query": "workflow_status by environment"
    },
    {
      "title": "Error Rate",
      "type": "counter",
      "query": "error_count by type"
    }
  ]
}
EOF
```

#### Step 10: Documentation and Training
```markdown
# Create operational runbook
docs/runbook.md:
  - Daily Operations
  - Emergency Procedures
  - Troubleshooting Guide
  - Contact Information

# Create training materials
docs/training/:
  - setup-guide.md
  - workflow-guide.md
  - troubleshooting.md
  - faq.md
```

## 3. Security Best Practices

### 3.1 Secret Management

```yaml
Secret Management Guidelines:
  Storage:
    - Use GitHub encrypted secrets only
    - Never commit secrets to repository
    - Rotate secrets quarterly
    - Use different secrets per environment
  
  Access:
    - Principle of least privilege
    - Environment-specific access
    - Audit secret access logs
    - Use service accounts where possible
  
  Rotation:
    - Automate password rotation
    - Track secret expiry dates
    - Maintain rotation audit trail
    - Test after rotation
```

### 3.2 Certificate Security

```yaml
Certificate Security Practices:
  Generation:
    - Minimum 2048-bit RSA keys
    - Use strong random number generation
    - Validate certificate chains
    - Enforce certificate policies
  
  Storage:
    - Encrypt certificates at rest
    - Limit certificate access
    - Audit certificate usage
    - Secure backup storage
  
  Transmission:
    - Use TLS for all API calls
    - Validate SSL certificates
    - Implement certificate pinning
    - Monitor for MITM attacks
```

### 3.3 Access Control

```yaml
Access Control Matrix:
  Developers:
    - Read access to non-prod
    - Execute non-prod workflows
    - No production access
  
  DevOps:
    - Full non-prod access
    - Read production logs
    - Execute with approval
  
  Security Team:
    - Full access all environments
    - Approve production changes
    - Audit trail access
  
  Automation:
    - Service account per environment
    - Minimal required permissions
    - No interactive access
```

## 4. Operational Best Practices

### 4.1 Monitoring and Alerting

```yaml
Monitoring Strategy:
  Proactive Monitoring:
    - Certificate expiry countdown
    - Workflow execution status
    - API availability checks
    - Error rate tracking
  
  Alert Thresholds:
    - Critical: < 7 days to expiry
    - Warning: < 30 days to expiry
    - Error: Workflow failures
    - Info: Successful renewals
  
  Alert Channels:
    - Critical: PagerDuty + Slack + Email
    - Warning: Slack + Email
    - Error: Slack + Email
    - Info: Slack only
```

### 4.2 Change Management

```yaml
Change Management Process:
  Non-Production:
    - Automated approval for renewals
    - Manual approval for config changes
    - Peer review for script changes
  
  Production:
    - CAB approval required
    - Change ticket mandatory
    - Rollback plan documented
    - Post-deployment verification
  
  Emergency Changes:
    - Expedited approval process
    - Security team override
    - Post-mortem required
    - Documentation within 24h
```

### 4.3 Capacity Planning

```yaml
Capacity Considerations:
  API Limits:
    - Apigee API rate limits
    - Let's Encrypt rate limits
    - DNS provider limits
  
  Workflow Limits:
    - Concurrent workflow runs
    - GitHub Actions minutes
    - Artifact storage limits
  
  Scaling Strategy:
    - Stagger environment checks
    - Implement request queuing
    - Use caching where appropriate
    - Monitor usage trends
```
