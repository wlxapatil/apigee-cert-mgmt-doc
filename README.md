## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the design and implementation of an automated certificate management solution for Apigee Edge. The solution automates the entire certificate lifecycle including monitoring, renewal, deployment, and notification across multiple environments (Dev, Test, UAT, and Production).

### 1.2 Business Benefits
- **Automated Certificate Management**: Eliminates manual certificate renewal processes
- **Zero Downtime**: Proactive certificate renewal before expiration
- **Security Compliance**: Enforces approval workflows for production deployments
- **Multi-Environment Support**: Manages certificates across all environments
- **Audit Trail**: Complete tracking tracking of all certificate operations
- **Cost Reduction**: Reduces operational overhead and prevents certificate expiration incidents

outages
